# EasyMusicPaste
A simple python script to paste reformatted tracklists to pastebin, relying on gist as a backup. Part of my music tagging suite of tools.
Takes a track formatted like Artist - songname and turn into 01 - songname. Numbers in track order. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the send-to-clipboard feature of Musicbee.
Feel free to use or modify.

# Installing
Download zip with big green code button up top. Unzip in desired directory. CD to directory with setup.py and do `pip install .` 
To use, copy the tracklist, go to your terminal and run `emp`

IMPORTANT:
Edit the config.py file with your API tokens, else you will not be able to upload.

## Note
This was made using AI, while I can hobble basic scripts, this was beyond me. Maybe one day I'll make one similiar by myself but this was meant to be a quick solution. Got it tested, refined and working.
