# EasyMusicPaste
A simple python script to paste reformatted tracklists to pastebin, relying on gist as a backup. Part of my music tagging suite of tools.
Takes a track formatted like Artist - songname and turn into 01 - songname. Numbers in track order. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the send-to-clipboard feature of Musicbee.
Feel free to use or modify, you should only share tracklists of songs for educational reasons.
